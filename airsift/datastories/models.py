# What is a Data Story?

Data Stories draw together different kinds of evidence to narrate the impact that air pollution is having in your area. This guide will assist you in writing a Data Story on Airsift. You can group together multiple forms of evidence that could include citizen data, regulatory data, weather data, local observations, maps and other kinds of visual and auditory media. Monitoring studies normally start from a series of questions that you want to ask about your local air quality. For more guidance on setting up an air quality study, please refer to the [AirKit Logbook](https://github.com/citizensense/AirKit_Logbook/blob/main/README.md).

# Writing Your Data Story

Writing a Data Story is a detailed and collaborative process that will likely require several iterations and revisions. The instructions below can act as a guideline to help you structure and complete a Data Story using citizen data and other forms of evidence. You can see this structure in action by browsing our [Covid Data Stories](https://datastories-covid.citizensense.net/). It can be helpful to include images of your local area in the data story to illustrate the landscape, highlight possible pollution sources, and demonstrate how and where sensors are installed.

1. Create an account by clicking "Sign In" and following the instructions to register.
2. Navigate to "Stories" in the top right-hand menu, and click "+Add a Data Story."
3. Create a title for your story, keeping it simple, short and descriptive.
4. Click the sections below numbered 0 to 5 and follow the instructions to write your story. You can follow these instructions as closely or freely as suits your study.
5. Use the toolbar to add simple formatting to your text (i.e., bold, italics etc.), add links to other media, and insert images and tables.
6. Upload images from your computer, or copy and paste plots from [Airsift Analysis](https://airsift.citizensense.net/analysis/).
7. Save your progress by selecting "Save Draft," on the bottom menu marked "Publish."
8. When you are ready to publish your Data Story, click "Publish." The story will be sent for moderation before publication.
9. You can [view and read published data stories here](/datastories)

This section can be adapted from to fit the context of your monitoring study. You can include an explanation that by the Dustbox 2.0 are similar devices are an "indicative" monitor, rather than regulatory station.

Here you can note whether you co-located monitors (before, after or ideally both), and your findings.

Note that while the World Health Organisation has established outdoor air quality guidelines for PM2.5, there is no safe level of exposure.

## How to establish evidence of elevated pollution

To establish whether there is evidence of elevated pollution in your area, you can follow these steps:

* Create a [line plot](https://airsift.citizensense.net/analysis/) for each Dustbox in your study area, selecting the monitoring period and mean.
* Review the peaks and baseline of the data.
* Are the World Health Organisation or local air-quality guidelines regularly breached?
* You can also compare the data you have collected to other monitors for this period, to see if other monitoring projects support your findings.
* You can compare different monitors--including background and roadside--to see if peaks are caused by local or regional sources of pollution.
* If pollution is local to your monitor, you will likely see a spike in your data in comparison to the background monitor. If pollution is regional, you will likely see similar peaks and troughs in comparison datasets.

In this section you can use Airsift to identify the times of day and weather conditions where PM2.5 concentrations are most prevalent. Using a combination of analysis methods will allow you to identify likely sources of particulates. It is important to include images of plots of charts here to illustrate your analysis. Plots can be downloaded or copied from the Analytics tool in Airsift.

## When is the source most evident?
**Time plots** can be used to analyze the times when pollution levels are most frequently elevated. Time plots aggregate PM2.5 concentrations according to time to indicate:

* Key patterns such as rush hour and traffic.
* Possible construction or industry sources.
* Regional pollution events due to seasonal variation

Create a plot for each of the Dustboxes in your monitoring study. Look for peaks across weekdays and weekends. If traffic is a source of pollution, you would expect to see peaks at times of increased congestion, i.e., the morning and evening rush hour.

When you look at each plot consider how the Dustbox installation could impact the data. Dustboxes that are close to the roadside will often register higher peaks at rush hour. Monitors located in background locations such as gardens might show peaks at different times, for example barbecues on Sunday afternoons.

Actions are recommendations for things that can be done to improve local air-quality and to mitigate the effects of pollution.
